# 🌱 Green Points Blockchain

A **local blockchain implementation** for rewarding environmental actions with Green Points (GP). This system uses proof-of-work consensus to create an immutable ledger of eco-friendly tasks and rewards.

## 🎯 Overview

Green Points Blockchain is a complete blockchain-based reward system that runs locally on your laptop. Users earn Green Points by completing environmental tasks like recycling, planting trees, saving energy, and more. The blockchain ensures transparent and tamper-proof record-keeping of all transactions.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external dependencies required (uses only Python standard library)

### Installation

1. Clone or navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd /home/kenx1kaneki/Desktop/greenPoints-local-Blockchain
```

2. Make scripts executable (optional):
```bash
chmod +x cli.py demo.py
```

### Running the Demo

See the blockchain in action with a pre-configured simulation:

```bash
python demo.py
```

This will:
- Initialize the blockchain
- Create 4 sample users
- Complete various environmental tasks
- Mine blocks with transactions
- Display the complete blockchain state
- Show leaderboard and statistics

### Using the Interactive CLI

Launch the interactive interface:

```bash
python cli.py
```

The CLI provides a full menu system for:
- Creating users
- Viewing available tasks
- Completing tasks
- Mining blocks
- Checking balances
- Transferring points
- Viewing blockchain state
- And more!

## 📖 How It Works

### 1. Blockchain Core

The blockchain uses **proof-of-work** consensus:
- Each block contains multiple transactions
- Blocks are linked via cryptographic hashes
- Mining requires finding a hash with specific leading zeros
- Default difficulty: 2 (configurable)

### 2. Green Points Economy

- **Task Rewards**: Complete environmental tasks to earn GP
- **Mining Rewards**: 10 GP for mining a block
- **Transfers**: Send GP to other users
- **System Account**: "SYSTEM" issues task rewards

### 3. Task Categories

Available task categories:
- 🔄 **Recycling**: Paper, plastic, electronics
- ⚡ **Energy Saving**: LED bulbs, reduced consumption
- 🚲 **Transportation**: Biking, public transport
- 💧 **Water Conservation**: Water-saving devices
- 🌳 **Tree Planting**: Community tree planting
- 🗑️ **Waste Reduction**: Composting, zero-waste shopping
- 📚 **Education**: Environmental workshops
- 🤝 **Community**: Cleanups, volunteering

### 4. Workflow Example

```
1. Alice creates a wallet → Gets unique address
2. Alice completes "Plant a Tree" task → 100 GP added to pending
3. Bob mines the block → Alice receives 100 GP, Bob gets 10 GP mining reward
4. Alice transfers 50 GP to Charlie → Transaction added to pending pool
5. Diana mines the block → Transfer is completed
```

## 💻 Code Examples

### Creating a Blockchain Programmatically

```python
from blockchain import Blockchain
from wallet import UserManager
from tasks import TaskManager
from transaction import Transaction

# Initialize components
blockchain = Blockchain(difficulty=2)
user_manager = UserManager()
task_manager = TaskManager()

# Create users
alice = user_manager.create_wallet("alice", "alice@example.com")
bob = user_manager.create_wallet("bob")

# Complete a task
tasks = task_manager.get_all_tasks()
completion = task_manager.complete_task(
    tasks[0].task_id,
    alice.address,
    "Recycled 10kg of paper"
)

# Create reward transaction
tx = Transaction(
    sender="SYSTEM",
    recipient=alice.address,
    amount=tasks[0].reward_points,
    transaction_type="task_reward",
    task_id=tasks[0].task_id
)
blockchain.add_transaction(tx.to_dict())

# Mine block
block = blockchain.mine_pending_transactions(bob.address)

# Check balance
print(f"Alice's balance: {blockchain.get_balance(alice.address)} GP")
```

### Validating the Blockchain

```python
# Check blockchain integrity
is_valid = blockchain.is_chain_valid()
print(f"Blockchain valid: {is_valid}")

# Display entire chain
blockchain.display_chain()
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Block Structure
```python
{
    "index": int,
    "timestamp": float,
    "transactions": [Transaction],
    "previous_hash": str,
    "nonce": int,
    "hash": str
}
```

### Transaction Structure
```python
{
    "transaction_id": str,
    "from": str,
    "to": str,
    "amount": float,
    "type": str,  # "transfer", "task_reward", "mining_reward"
    "timestamp": float,
    "task_id": str (optional),
    "task_name": str (optional)
}
```

### Mining Algorithm

The proof-of-work algorithm requires finding a nonce such that:
```
SHA256(block_data + nonce) starts with 'difficulty' number of zeros
```

With difficulty=2, the hash must start with "00..."
